# Gas Pipe Inspection Predictive Maintenance

## Introduction
Predictive maintenance is the process of anticipating when a piece of equipment or machinery might fail, and taking proactive steps to prevent that failure. In this Kaggle datathon project, we aim to design the sequence in which gas pipes need to be inspected, which might have a considerable effect on the operation and carbon footprint of the gas company.

## Problem Statement
Our task is to predict the result of the inspections that took place in 2021 and 2022. More specifically, we will tackle a binary classification problem to determine whether each pipe that was inspected had an incidence or not. We have been provided with data on the characteristics of each pipe and on the previous inspections carried out on the network before the end of 2020.

## Dataset
The solution set contains more than 900K inspected pipes. The data includes a wide range of features such as pipe length, diameter, material, location, etc.

## Evaluation Metric
The metric for this competition was the area under the ROC curve.

## Usage
As we have signed an NDA, we are unable to share the data that was used to train our model. However, we have included the code used to build the model in the Jupyter Notebook `Submission.ipynb`. To replicate our results, you will need to source your own data and update the data paths in the notebook.
